# The main core of this project
Try to use the meaning of Usagi's call in Chiikawa to write a programming language

# The idea for this project
* This provides the main core idea of ​​the project design [source](https://github.com/eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee/eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee)
* This video provides an explanation of the meaning of the Usagi language and serves as a reference for this project [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oDW26PYQ3M)

# The process of mapping the meaning of Usagi's call to programming language
Step 1. Organize the existing Usagi's call meaning table
1. Ura: to express agreement, yes, and occasionally to greet people by saying hello
2. Ha: to express doubt or misunderstanding
3. Purururururu: to express excitement
4. Yaha: to express various emotions

Step 2. 
Corresponding to C language (configuration reasons)
1. Ura can represent true
(because it means affirmation, usually true or 1)
2. Ha can be represented as if (because it means doubt)
3. Purururururu represents return (because it is usually the last step of each function. I believe that when writing a program, you should be very excited after writing the last return and can compile and see the program run)
4. The Yaha combination includes the following (originally to express various emotions, corresponding to the code I think it is a few of the most commonly used symbols XD)
YAHA_ {
YA_HA }
YAHA_A [
YA_AHA ]
YAAHA (
YAHAA )
YAAHAA ;
